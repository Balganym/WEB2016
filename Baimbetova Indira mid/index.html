			<h4>Kazakh-British Technical University</h4>
				<div class="text1"><p> The idea to establish KBTU belongs to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had a number of meetings with official representatives of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This activity resulted in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the two states in November 2000. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and RK President Nursultan Nazarbayev became Patrons of the University.</p>

<p>The University was established by Resolution No 1027 of the RK Government dated August 3, 2001, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the RK Ministry of Education and Science and the British Council. On behalf of Kazakhstan, the founder is the RK Government and the authorized agency is the RK Ministry of Education and Science. </p></div>

			<h4>Student accomodation </h4>
				<div class="text2"><p> KBTU provides accommodation at the Students’ Residence Hall for students in need of housing.</p>

<p>KBTU offers a comfortable Students’ Residence Hall with a separate guarded territory of more than one hectare for students from regions outside Almaty.
The Residence Hall comprises 4 buildings.
There are single and multiple occupancy (2, 3, 4-person) comfortably furnished rooms with Internet facilities, separate study rooms with Wi-Fi Internet coverage, utility rooms and rooms equipped with automatic washing machines and ironing boards. There is a reading room with diverse literature and periodicals. For students’ leisure activities there are lounges with cable TV and a gym.

Pines, junipers, lilacs, and the well-kept lawn create a friendly and peaceful atmosphere where you can rest from the bustle of the city. KBTU’s Residence Hall is not a dormitory in the conventional sense, it's a real home with ideal conditions for living and recreation!  </p></div>
